# House Pricing Prediction Using Supervised Learning

This project demonstrates a **supervised learning** approach to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant factors. The goal is to use historical data to train a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices for new or unseen data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical values to ensure model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and neighborhood are selected and engineered to enhance predictive performance.
- **Model Training:** Several supervised learning algorithms, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**, are implemented and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model’s performance is assessed using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared**, and cross-validation techniques.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and insights.
  
## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Historical house pricing data is collected and split into training and testing sets.
2. **Training**: The training dataset is used to fit different machine learning models, learning the relationship between features and the target (house price).
3. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts house prices on the test set and is evaluated for accuracy.
4. **Analysis**: Visualizations and metrics are used to analyze the model’s performance, highlighting any areas for improvement.

## Future Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate more detailed features such as proximity to schools, public transport, and market trends.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Explore ensemble techniques to combine the strengths of multiple models.
